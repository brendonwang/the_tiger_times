As you know, weâ€™re in our 6th unit of math. Recently, we have studied parentheses in equations, unneeded information, and two step problems.

For a review, try this problem! Jackie, Jake, James, Jacob and Jane all saved specific amounts of money. Jane had ${$24}$. Jackie had ${$5.78}$ more than Jake. Jake had $2$ times as much as James. James had ${$2.17}$ less than Jacob. Jacob had ${$18.39}$. How much money did Jackie have? (Hint: Remove the unneeded information, then work through the problem backward.).
