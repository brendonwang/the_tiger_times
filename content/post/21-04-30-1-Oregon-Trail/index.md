As you know, we have been on the Oregon Trail for over 5 months. Our journey had been uneventful and dull. We recently crossed the Rocky Mountain, where tragedy struck. Crossing the Rocky Mountains was hard but it became harder when the Smiths wagon broke. It all happened when the Smithâ€™s wagons axel slipped, the wagon came tumbling down with speed and so we couldn't stop it. The animals and their belongings were fine, but the wagon was shattered into pieces, it was a terrible sight to hold. We had a meeting and decided to share the wagon with them. Poor Smiths, they had already gotten Cholera and now their wagon shattered into pieces! ðŸ˜¢

We also had a successful encounter with the Indians! Elmira, our translator talked to them in there native language. They wanted to trade fresh salmon for our food like: Flour, Beans, Sugar, Molasses and Salt. We may even trade clothing. They will be coming later today for the trading.

Our journey has been difficult and stressful, but it will be worth it in the end!
