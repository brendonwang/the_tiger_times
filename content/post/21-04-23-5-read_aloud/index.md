Yumi’s sister Yuri has quit medical school and is not answering her phone. Meanwhile Yumi almost got revealed as Yumi to Phillipe but managed to say that Kay is her English name. At comedy camp Yumi came up with a plan to get her parents to transfer her to PAMS. Her plan is to trick her parents to come to the Haha Club to see her perform and get them to be impressed, then ace the SSAT to show that she can get great grades while having fun with comedy. She convinced her mom to let her go to the senior center but they didn’t know that she was doing comedy. She cracked some jokes but her 2nd one was not popular and it offended Sienna. When she went home her dad is so pumped up because he is installing the karaoke section.
