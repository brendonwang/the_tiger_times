As you know, we have been on the Oregon Trail for 46 days, and we are right now in the middle of current day Nebraska.  Our journey had been uneventful but one frightful day, a thunderstorm occurs!

Lightning flashes, clouds rumble, and rain pounds down. The dirt trail turns sloshy, and one wagon turns over! The poor Websters lose all their food!

Luckily, we are only nine days away from the nearest trading point, Fort Laramie. The Websters have a decent amount of money left so they can buy more food. Until we reach Fort Laramie, each family will have to share some food with the Websters.

As if that wasn’t bad enough, 3 days away from Fort Laramie, a disease broke out on our wagon train! The Smiths, Millers, and Lucy Fletcher caught a mystery illness. The Millers died! To save the Smiths and Ms. Lucy, we used clues and found out the secret disease to get the antidote.

It was Cholera! Cholera was quite common in the 1840’s. It can be caused by contaminated food and water. Its symptoms are high fever, vomiting, thirst, and diarrhea. Its cure is rehydrated.
