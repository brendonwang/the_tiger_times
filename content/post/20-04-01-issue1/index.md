# The Oregon Trail 
- By IRA TIWARY 
{{< figure src="the_oregon_trail.jpeg">}}

As you know, we have been on the Oregon Trail for 46 days, and we are right now in the middle of current day Nebraska.  Our journey had been uneventful but one frightful day, a thunderstorm occurs!

Lightning flashes, clouds rumble, and rain pounds down. The dirt trail turns sloshy, and one wagon turns over! The poor Websters lose all their food!

Luckily, we are only nine days away from the nearest trading point, Fort Laramie. The Websters have a decent amount of money left so they can buy more food. Until we reach Fort Laramie, each family will have to share some food with the Websters.

As if that wasn’t bad enough, 3 days away from Fort Laramie, a disease broke out on our wagon train! The Smiths, Millers, and Lucy Fletcher caught a mystery illness. The Millers died! To save the Smiths and Ms. Lucy, we used clues and found out the secret disease to get the antidote.

It was Cholera! Cholera was quite common in the 1840’s. It can be caused by contaminated food and water. Its symptoms are high fever, vomiting, thirst, and diarrhea. Its cure is rehydrated.  


# New Read Aloud Stand up Yumi Chung
- By SILVIA SOHN 
{{< figure src="the_oregon_trail.jpeg">}}
Our class picked the third book for read aloud in this year: Stand up, Yumi Chung! This book was written by Jessica Kim. It is about a girl named Yumi Chung, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Korea. Her parents own a restaurant. Her mom would sneak in some white lies in order to make her family look the best they can be. Her dad has lots of big ideas-that don’t always work. And her sister is a genius. And what about Yumi, you might ask. Well, all she needs is a stage and courage.
