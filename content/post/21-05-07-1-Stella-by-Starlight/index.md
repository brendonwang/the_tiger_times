Recently, we have started the book Stella by Starlight, written by Sharon M. Draper. This is the book we will read and work with. We will analyze this book, the characters, and the setting. So far, we have read chapters one to ten. In case you forgot, here’s the summary:

Stella Mills lives in the segregated south, in Bumblebee, North Carolina. Life has gone pretty normally for her until one chilly night in October. She and her brother, up later than they should be, much less wandering around, see a group of nine white-robed men set fire to a black cross. The Ku Klux Klan. Swift and silently, the two of them run to their parents and tell them everything. Their parents immediately call all the African American men in Bumblebee for a meeting. Stella is not allowed to listen. The next morning, she and the rest of the African American kids go to school. Their teacher, Mrs. Grayson, reminds them to always stay in a group and not wander. Then, she gives everyone a writing assignment. Stella believes that she can’t do it and gives up. As a result, she gets an ‘F’. Desperate to get a better grade, Stella promises her teacher that she would write another story at her house. Late at night, she goes outside and writes another story, about herself.

We are all waiting to see what Stella writes about, and what grade she will get. Also, Stella has discovered that Mr. Packard is part of the Ku Klux Klan. We all have lots of interpretive questions about this. Does Paulette (Mr. Packard’s daughter) know that he is part of the Klan? Does she encourage it? Is she OK with it?

In work related to Stella, we have done a set of questions about the first five chapters, and a pre-reading assignment. Also, we have been assigned questions about chapters six to ten and have a fun crosswords puzzle! One of the activities is to write about what Stella saw at the Kilkenny Pond. That will be exciting to do, and we will have to look back at the book to catch some intriguing details.

It would be fun if you could search some fun facts about the Ku Klux Klan or segregation and send it to me. If you would, you would have an extra special mention in the Tiger Times, and your interesting fact would be shared!

We all cannot wait to read more of this interesting and nicely told historical fiction novel! If you would like to read something else by this author, Out of this World is a wildly popular book as well. And for those who have already read this book, guess what, the sequel is coming out this September! It is called Out of my Heart.
