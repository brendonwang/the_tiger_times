Yumi tried to make it up to Jasmine but misses her chance. Soon the real Kay comes, and she runs away and Jasmine chances her until she ran into her parents! She got ratted out and left comedy camp when she got home, she got her phone taken away from her. Later we realize they owe Mr. Montgomery so they try to do their grand reopening with their karaoke, but no one used it and they realized they were losing money from it and not gaining. Yumi talks to her dad about comedy and he talks about how he used to want to be a singer and how he wishes that instead of comedy she should learn so she doesnâ€™t worry about money. When she finally gets her phone back, she realizes that Felipe and Sienna are not mad at her and are just worried. I wonder what will happen next.
