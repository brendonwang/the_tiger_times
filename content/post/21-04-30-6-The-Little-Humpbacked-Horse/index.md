This week, we synthesized The Little Humpbacked Horse, choosing pages and writing the important events in that page. Also, we wrote beyond the story. Imagining what would happen to the white mare after Little Fool Ivan set her free! There are 2 steps of this process, first, you put your ideas in an organizer, then, you write the whole story. What do you think will happen? Will she find another person and bear more colts? Will she start bothering Ivanâ€™s family? Will she run around the world? Would she travel? If so, where? The possibilities are endless!
