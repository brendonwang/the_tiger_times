As you all know we have been reading a book full of cliff hangers called Stand up Yumi Chung! In the past Yumi has gone through hard times. Her parents don’t listen to her dreams of being a famous comedian, they want for Yumi to go to a great school and get all straight A’s just like her ultra-genius sister, Yuri.

Anyway, if you miss a read aloud or have a lag, just read this and you’ll know what happened this week!

Chung’s Barbecue is having a lot of Financial issues lately.  Yumi’s dad came up with this great idea, they would redecorate the Restaurant, make a karaoke stage and much more. They also came up with coupons which led to their doom. On the grand opening night, they made 6000 $ less than they were supposed to. There Restaurant would have too close in couple of days…

Yumi found out her dad liked to sing and dreamed of being a star.

Yumi keeps wondering about Felipe and Siena. This same thought struck her every now and then: Are they angry at me? Finally, she gathers up her courage to face time them both. She called Felipe first. Luckily Siena was at his house. She had luck and explained everything through. She also told them about her family’s trouble, and how her older sister was moving away. They chatted away, Siena said something about how she always wanted to go to an open mike opening. Then an idea struck Yumi, her family could hold one at the Restaurant so they could earn the rest of the money, she explained everything and told them to spread the word. She also  apologized to Jasmine Jasper who accepted it and put a notice about the open mike night on her vlog. Next was the hard part, convincing her parents. She succeeded in this too.

The open mike night was a big hit. Yumi went on stage and shared secrets she never would have. That night they made around 7000 dollars! They can keep the restaurant!

Sadly, after a week Yuri is leaving to go to Nepal to join the Peace Corps. Yumi’s helping her pack her stuff. She gives Yuri a small gift… It’s the same black thread which Yuri thought was a spider! Yumi says it’s a overcome your fear gift. The whole family is bad at goodbyes so Yumi suggests they take a selfie. Click! When Yumi looks to see the pic the color drains from her face. Her exam results came. She gives the phone to her mom who reads it and squeals with delight. Yumi had passed!!!

After finishing Stand up, Yumi Chung!, we have started a new read aloud! It's called Our only May Amelia. This is a book set in the 1800's of Washington. It is about a girl named May Amelia who has 7 brothers and is the only sister. Her mother is going to have another baby, and she hopes that she is a girl. However, her father does not want another girl. On her birthday, she wishes for her birthday wish that she gets a baby sister. May has never left the Nasel) where she lives) and desperately wants to go somewhere else. Then, her aunt offers to take May with her to Astoria. SO, May heads out, with her brothers Ivan, Alvin, and Wilbert, on a boat to Astoria. We are all waiting to see what mischief happens! This book is quite funny and enjoyable, and we can't wait to continue reading it!
