On Friday, we made Mother's Day Pop-up Cards! Anna and Audrey volunteer to show the class how to make them. They had different versions though, so we decided to have two groups. People would choose which group they wanted to be in. Anna would teach one of the groups to make her version and Audrey would teach the other group how to make a different type. Audrey made a simple pop up card with colorful decorations and paper latches. Anna's looked like a gift when closed and looked like a cake when opened. Ira also made one that was a heart shape with a rose in the middle and a butterfly on one side. Here are two youtube videos that teach you how to make some pop up cards.
