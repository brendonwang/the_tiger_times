The PTA has set up a cool running club map called the green glitter route that is 2.5 miles long at every course marker you can get a funny question and you can have fun answering them along the way and after you run you can get a special foot token by sending an email to [runners@medinapta.org](mailto:runners@medinapta.org). To get more information go to [https://medinapta.membershiptoolkit.com/clubs/runners#maps](https://medinapta.membershiptoolkit.com/clubs/runners#maps).
