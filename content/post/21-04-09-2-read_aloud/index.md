Our class picked the third book for read aloud in this year: Stand up, Yumi Chung! This book was written by Jessica Kim. It is about a girl named Yumi Chung, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Korea. Her parents own a restaurant. Her mom would sneak in some white lies in order to make her family look the best they can be. Her dad has lots of big ideas-that donâ€™t always work. And her sister is a genius. And what about Yumi, you might ask. Well, all she needs is a stage and courage.
