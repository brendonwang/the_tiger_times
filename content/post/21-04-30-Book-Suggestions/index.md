I don’t know about you, but I am CONSTANTLY trying to find a book to read. So, if you want to shorten the time you spend scouring the corners of the internet for books, just read the following books in these ratings!

Sisters Grimm | Michael Buckley | 288 pages long | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Rated by: Danya Shah

The Sister’s Grimm is a fantasy book about two sisters, Sabrina Grimm and Daphne Grimm. The series consists of 9 novels. Here is a short part of book 1.

*Splintering wood and damp soil rained from the sky as the tree they crouched behind was violently uprooted. The two girls looked up into the horrible face above them and felt scorching breath blow through their hair. What has happened to our lives? Sabrina wondered. When did the world become unrecognizable? And what had happened to her, the eleven-year-old girl who only two days prior had been an orphan on a train?*



The Thing About Luck | Cynthia Kadohata | 304 pages long | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Rated by: Ms. Kaminoff

The Thing About Luck is about a 12-year-old girl named Summer. Summer and her brothers are the grandchildren of farmers who must get a harvest in during a short period of time at the end of the summer. The grandparents get ill and it is up to the kids to step up and help in a significant way. Ms. Kaminoff says that she likes it because of the style of life that she has no experience with. She also really like the characters, their humor, determination, and courage! A short part:

*Ko-un is good luck in Japanese and one year my family had none of it. We were cursed with bad luck, bad luck chased us around pointing her bony finger. We got 7 flat tires in six weeks, I got malaria one of 1,500 cases in the United States that year and my grandmother's spine started causing her excruciating pain.*



The Iron Trial | Holly Black & Cassandra Clare | 304 pages long | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Rated by: Ms. Kaminoff

This book is an INTENSE fantasy about a boy who seems to be destined to do something destructive and tragic with his magical gifts. His father has told him horrifying stories about mage school, but even though Callum (the boy) tries desperately to fail the entrance test, he got selected- and it’s not optional. This book is part of a 5-novel series. Ms. Kaminoff has only read the first book! A short part:

*From a distance, the man struggling up the white face of the glacier might have looked like an ant crawling slowly up the side of a dinner plate. The shantytown of La Rinconada was a collection of scattered specks far below him, the wind increasing as his elevation did, blowing powdery gusts of snow into his face and freezing the damp tendrils of his black hair. Despite his Amber goggles, he winced at the brightness of the reflected sunset. Still, the man was not afraid of falling, although he was using no ropes or belay lines, only crampons and a single ice axe. His name was Alastair Hunt and he was a mage.*



Rash | Pete Hautman | 272 pages long | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Rated by: Ms. Kaminoff

Rash is a science fiction novel that is set in the year 2074 where because the US has so many laws to protect citizens from harm, nearly ¼ of the population is imprisoned in work camps for violating the law. Bo has a bad temper and ends up in a camp run by a corporation that is using the inmates in ways that are themselves illegal. Ms. Kaminoff says that she really enjoyed this book- though it might better be suited for middle school students. This author has many great books to check out about interesting questions or imagining dystopian futures that are quite interesting. Part of the cover says, In the year 2074, French fries are illegal, football has been banned, and running isn’t just for your health anymore. A short part:

*Gramps, who was born in 1990, once told me that when he was my age the only way to wind up in prison in the USSA (back when it had only one S) was to steal something, kill somebody, or use illegal drugs.*

*“Illegal drugs? You mean like beer?” I asked, pointing at his mug of homebrew.*

*He laughed. “No, Bo. Beer was legal back then. I’m talking about heroin, marijuana, and cocaine. Drugs like that.”*

*“They sent people to jail for that?”*

*“They sure did,” he said, sipping his beer. Gramp’s home-brewed beer was one of our family secrets.*



Spy School | Stuart Gibbs | 290 pages long | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Rated by: T Sai Priyam

Spy school is a really good series about spies who go on secret missions and thwart other evil organizations’ plans. For example, the evil organization once wanted to murder the president so that the vice president could be the ruler. The vice president was secretly part of the evil team called SPYDER. Some book examples in the series in order are: Spy School, Spy Camp, Evil Spy School, Ski Spy School, Spy School Secret Service, Spy School Goes South, Spy School British Invasion, Spy School Revolution, and the ninth book, Spy School at Sea will be released on August 31, 2021. WHEW, that was a lot of books. A part of book 1:
*Ripley Residence 2107 Mockingbird Road Vienna, Virginia January 16 1530 hours*

*“Hello, Ben,” said the man in my living room. “My name is Alexander Hale. I work for the CIA.”*

*And just like that, my life became interesting.*

*It hadn’t been, up till then. Not by a long shot. That day had been a prime example: day 4,583, seven months into the twelfth year of my mundane existence. I had dragged myself out of bed, eaten breakfast, went to middle school, been bored in class, stared at girls I was too embarrassed to approach, had lunch, slogged through the gym, fallen asleep in math, been harassed by Dirk the Jerk, taken the bus home . . .*

*And found a man in a tuxedo sitting on the couch.*
