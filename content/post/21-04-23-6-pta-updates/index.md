## Ms. Veronica’s awards

Our beloved custodian Ms. Veronica has been working very hard and has been awarded the “Well maintained equipment award” and the “Well maintained school award”. This is even better because not only did she win those rewards she won them during a pandemic. All in all we give our thanks to Ms. Veronica for keeping our school clean and keeping our hybrid friends safe.
