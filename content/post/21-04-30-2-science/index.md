Science is back again! This time, we are studying the unit called ‘Living Systems’.

“What is a system?”, you ask. Well, a system is any collection (big or small) of interacting parts that work together to make a whole, or produce or perform a function.

How do you know if something is a system? Think about an object. Let’s say… glasses that you wear to see better. Are there interacting parts in a pair of glasses? Yes! Glasses have two lenses, that help you see better. The two lenses are connected by a bridge that rets on your nose. To avoid having your nose punctured from the lenses, there are nose pads. The temple of the frame curl around your ear comfortably. Wow, there are a lot of parts in a pair of glasses! So, a pair of glasses is a system!

What other systems can you think of? There are systems everywhere! Some are industrial, like factories that create cars. Some are social, like parties and festivals. Some are technological, like computers. Some are natural, like the water cycle. In fact, we ourselves are systems! We have arms, legs, organs and many more interacting parts.

Earth is a system too! A very big system! A system which has many more systems inside it. So, what are those inner systems called?

Subsystems! The definition of a subsystem is: A system part of a larger system.

The Earth has four big subsystems: the GEOSPHERE, the HYDROSPHERE, the ATMOSPHERE, and the BIOSPHERE. The Geosphere contains the crust, mantle, and core. The Hydrosphere contains all water on, under, and above Earth. There is water as water vapor and in the soil below Earth. On Earth there is salt-water and fresh-water. All interacting parts of the Hydrosphere! The Atmosphere is made up with interacting gases and air. It has subsystems like the Thermosphere, etc. The Biosphere is all living life, like plants and animals.

The Biosphere has subsystems called Biomes. Some examples of Biomes are Rainforests, Deserts, and Woodlands. The Biosphere also has subsystems called Ecosystems. Ecosystems are living organisms organized into complex communities. Ecosystems consist of non-living, and living parts. The living parts are the Fauna and Flora. Fauna and Flora are scientific words for animal and plant life (animal being Fauna; plant being Flora). The non-living parts are the temperature, moisture, and wind.

Now, let’s get back to Biomes. Biomes have more subsystems called food chains. Food chains are feeding relationships, with a consumer eating a producer, a secondary-consumer eating the consumer, and then finally a decomposer eating a secondary-consumer.

“What are all those things she just mentioned!?” you say. Well, let’s start with a producer. A producer is a living organism who makes its own food. A very common and so-super-obvious example would be grass. Grass makes its own food using sunlight, water, and nutrients from the soil. A consumer is a creature that eats the producer. In a woodland Biome, that scenario would occur if a deer ate some grass. Then, there is a secondary-consumer. That means, a creature that eats the creature that ate the producer. In a woodland Biome that would mean that a cougar ate the deer.

Then, there are decomposers. Decomposers are organisms that decompose any un-dead creature. Decomposers can eat any organism, whether its grass, a deer, or a cougar. Decomposers are commonly bacteria or fungi.

On a chart, you would write grass, a deer, a cougar, and bacteria. You would draw an arrow connecting grass and deer, the arrow pointing to the deer. In the same way, you would draw an arrow starting from the deer and pointing to the cougar. And for the bacteria, well, three arrows would be pointing to it, as it can eat all three organisms.

You must be thinking, “What an interesting way to draw arrows!”. You draw the arrows to point in the direction the energy is flowing. When the deer eats the grass, the energy the grass got from the sun gets transferred to the deer. And so on, so on.

We are all very excited to learn about this fascinating subject, and I hope that this article will help you in your studies!
