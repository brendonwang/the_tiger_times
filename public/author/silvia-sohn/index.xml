Our class picked the third book for read aloud in this year: Stand up, Yumi Chung! This book was written by Jessica Kim. It is about a girl named Yumi Chung, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Korea. Her parents own a restaurant. Her mom would sneak in some white lies in order to make her family look the best they can be. Her dad has lots of big ideas-that don’t always work. And her sister is a genius. And what about Yumi, you might ask. Well, all she needs is a stage and courage.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Math</title><link>http://tigertimes.netlify.app/post/21-04-09-3-math/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://tigertimes.netlify.app/post/21-04-09-3-math/</guid><description>&lt;p>

As you know, we’re in our 6th unit of math. Recently, we have studied parentheses in equations, unneeded information, and two step problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a review, try this problem! Jackie, Jake, James, Jacob and Jane all saved specific amounts of money. Jane had ${$24}$. Jackie had ${$5.78}$ more than Jake. Jake had $2$ times as much as James. James had ${$2.17}$ less than Jacob. Jacob had ${$18.39}$. How much money did Jackie have? (Hint: Remove the unneeded information, then work through the problem backward.).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
