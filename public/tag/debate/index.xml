On April 20th, we had a debate based on why we should or should not worry about robots taking over human jobs. We had 2 debates on this topic. The first debate, the Yes side was Berenice, Ira, Silvia, Angela and Yabin. For the No side we had Julie, Yijia, Anushka, Victoria, and Natalie. For the second debate, the Yes side was Sahana, Audrey, Anna, Lily, and Sarah. And for the No side we had Brendon, Eugene, Eunsol, Danya, and T Sai Priyam. Both debates did an amazing job and we are patiently waiting for the results and the winners. This debate topic was an interesting one and the things we learned while researching for the debate were fascinating. Did you know that Roughly half of all the robots in the world are in Asia, 32% in Europe, and 16% in North America?&lt;/p&gt;
