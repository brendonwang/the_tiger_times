Yumi’s sister Yuri has quit medical school and is not answering her phone. Meanwhile Yumi almost got revealed as Yumi to Phillipe but managed to say that Kay is her English name. At comedy camp Yumi came up with a plan to get her parents to transfer her to PAMS. Her plan is to trick her parents to come to the Haha Club to see her perform and get them to be impressed, then ace the SSAT to show that she can get great grades while having fun with comedy. She convinced her mom to let her go to the senior center but they didn’t know that she was doing comedy. She cracked some jokes but her 2nd one was not popular and it offended Sienna. When she went home her dad is so pumped up because he is installing the karaoke section.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oregon Trail</title><link>http://tigertimes.netlify.app/post/21-04-23-1-oregon-trail/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://tigertimes.netlify.app/post/21-04-23-1-oregon-trail/</guid><description>

&lt;p>We’re back on this adventurous journey! We just passed through Fort Laramie. Our AMAZING Wagon Train Leader convinced the guards to let the un-sick people through. All of us re-stocked on supplies. Now we’re heading through the treacherous South Pass, which is filled with rocky hills and bumps. We tied young pines to our wagons so that they would slow us down by dragging on the ground with their branches. However, one day, the Smiths were leading us when a mishap struck. Their wagon crossed over a bumpy rock and their axel broke! Then, their wagon went racing down the rocky hill, the young pines useless. Their wagon landed at the foot of the hill and broke in many pieces! The Smiths were all right and most of their supplies were too. Their animals were fine as well. But their wagon was destroyed. The wagon train decided to put some supplies on the wagons, while the rest would be loaded onto the animals, as they were fine. We would go to Fort Bridger (which was really nearby) and buy a new wagon later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Debate</title><link>http://tigertimes.netlify.app/post/21-04-23-7-the-debate/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://tigertimes.netlify.app/post/21-04-23-7-the-debate/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="img.png" alt="img.png">
On April 20th, we had a debate based on why we should or should not worry about robots taking over human jobs. We had 2 debates on this topic. The first debate, the Yes side was Berenice, Ira, Silvia, Angela and Yabin. For the No side we had Julie, Yijia, Anushka, Victoria, and Natalie. For the second debate, the Yes side was Sahana, Audrey, Anna, Lily, and Sarah. And for the No side we had Brendon, Eugene, Eunsol, Danya, and T Sai Priyam. Both debates did an amazing job and we are patiently waiting for the results and the winners. This debate topic was an interesting one and the things we learned while researching for the debate were fascinating. Did you know that Roughly half of all the robots in the world are in Asia, 32% in Europe, and 16% in North America?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What we did during Spring break</title><link>http://tigertimes.netlify.app/post/21-04-23-3-spring-break/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://tigertimes.netlify.app/post/21-04-23-3-spring-break/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="interview-with-student-michelle-z--mrs-behans-class">Interview with student Michelle Z. , Mrs. Behan’s class.&lt;/h3>
